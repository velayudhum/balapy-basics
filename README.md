this is basic python problem solution

Sentence = """A pyt#hon i!s a co%nstri^cting s\nake belong@ing to the
P*ython (genus), or, more gene[]rally, any sna+ke in the fa-mily #$%
Py/thoni%dae (cont/aining the Pyt<>?hon g"en\tus)."""

              output: python

3) Display a sentence with each word as capitalized form.

2) Display the count of each characters (including both lower case and
uppercase)
